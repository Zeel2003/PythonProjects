    <h1>About Me:</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm <b>Zeel Patel</b>. I'm passionate about computers and creating
      cool things with them. . Currently , I'm studying Computer Science at
      Rutgers and learning about things like programming, how computers work,
      and making programs run faster.
      <br />
      I'm good at coding in Python and Java, and I'm also learning about
      important stuff like Data Structures and Algorithms. I've used tools like
      Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, and I'm familiar with other
      programming languages like C, C++, and React too.
      <br />
      I've done some work as a Medical Office Assistant, where I helped manage
      appointments and records. I also worked at Amazon and CompoSecure LLC,
      where I learned how to work in teams and get things organized.
      <br />
      I got a chance to do a cool virtual internship at JPMorgan & Chase Co.,
      where I helped show data to traders. I also completed a course on Python
      and I'm currently learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms on
      udemy.
      <br />
      My goal is to join a company that loves new ideas and technology, where I
      can use my problem-solving skills to make things work better.
